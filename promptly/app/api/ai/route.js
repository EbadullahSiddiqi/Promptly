Let me share some Skype alumni product perspectives:\n\nWhen I first heard the rumor, I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I reached out to my ex-Skype colleagues, and it turned out to be true. The app that once defined online communication is officially being retired.\n\nFor me, Skype wasn‚Äôt just a product. It shaped my career. It kick-started my journey as a remote worker and later became my stepping stone as a Senior Product Manager on the team. But let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶ nostalgia only works for so long. Skype had been declining for years.Microsoft didn‚Äôt kill Skype overnight. It was a slow process, a textbook case of strategic focus shifting elsewhere.\n\nWhen Microsoft bought Skype, they saw its potential. But as the internet evolved, Slack was rising, video conferencing became mainstream, and businesses needed better collaboration tools. So Microsoft went all in on Teams, using Skype‚Äôs backend to power it.\n\nInternally, the question was clear: why keep both?\n\nI was there. We had data showing that Skype still had millions of monthly active users. But people were leaving just as fast as they were joining. Then came COVID-19. Skype had one last shot at a comeback. With the world desperate for video calls, we saw a massive surge in users. But instead of thriving, Skype collapsed under the weight of technical debt and years of neglect.\n\nZoom took off. Microsoft pushed Teams\nSkype?\nLeft behind.\n\nThe focus shifted from making Skype great again to monetizing what was left. And we all know what happens when user experience takes a backseat to monetization.\n\nThis strategy, or rather counter-strategy, finally run Skype to the ground.\n\nFrom a business perspective, it makes sense. Teams surpassed Slack in active users, thanks to its deep integration with Microsoft 365. It inherited Skype‚Äôs voice and video capabilities, making it a more complete package. In the end, Skype became redundant.\n\nSo, farewell Skype. Thanks for the memories, the career boost, and the product lessons. You didn‚Äôt have to go out like this‚Ä¶ but given what happened, this was inevitable.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk. What do you think went wrong with Skype?
